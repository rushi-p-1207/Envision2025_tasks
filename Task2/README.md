write here what you understood from each task, challenges faced if any

I understood how to make linear and logistic regression models using python and also learned to implement exisiting models imported from modules. The major challenge i faced was in understanding the math behind logistic regression. The other challenge i faced was in doing the task which required to find if any two columns are related as i was getting errors with .corr().
