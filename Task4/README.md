Used regular ANN for the first task.
Felt more comfortable using TensorFlow inplace of Pytorch
Had taken help from YouTube videos and AI to do the tasks.(Found video which performed the exact same tasks, used it to understand the code)
Subtasks 2 and 3 took very long to run, reduced epochs in 2 which mostly explains the low accuracy.
Understood different optimizers, activation functions and when to use them.
Found the importance of data scaling as accuracy values changed a lot.
